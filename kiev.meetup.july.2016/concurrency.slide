* Concurrency is not parallelism

# Parallelism it's a simultaneous execution of any computations
# Concurrency independently execution of processes. And the way to compose it.
# Concurrency is about organising, but parallelism - execution.

* The roots

- Context switching

Kernel switches the CPU attention between processes.
Has huge overhead, because a need of storing/restoring all the CPU registers for processes. Switches unpredictable (can occur at any point in an execution).
# TLB cache
# Overhead of the operating system context switch, and the overhead of the scheduler function to choose the next process to occupy the CPU

- Threads

Threads are the same processes but share common memory space. Easier to switches between. But still expensive.

* Stack

* Goroutines


- Goroutine starts with the 2k stack on a heap. Compiler inserts check in every function call. And if there are not enough free space, it allocates new segment and moves contents there. So it can start with a small stack. Wich, in turn, can even be shrunk by GC.

- Cooperatively scheduled by the runtime. Cheap to create and manage. Runtime switches between at well-defined points. Unlike OS, which can switch threads at any time. 

* Scheduler
# On each M (OS thread) there is special goroutine - `g0` that keeps the borders of thread stack in own stack.
# M:N multiplexing

*M* - OS thread, *P* - context of execution, *G* - gouroutine.

* Scheduler

- *P* = *GOMAXPROCS*
- *M* s can be much more than *P*
- Work stealing

# What happens on C or syscall - stack switching from goroutine stack into a stack of os thread (which keeps by g0).
# That's why C funcs bids to the thread.
# runtime.LockOSThread() / runtime.UnlockOSThread()

* Happens before

#  !!! CSP

# !!! All is good until we have no concurrency

Compiler and processors can reorder reads and writes in single goroutine, in case it doesn't change program behavior.
# To specify the requirements of reads and writes, we define happens before, a partial order on the execution of memory operations in a Go program.
# If event e1 happens before event e2, then we say that e2 happens after e1. Also, if e1 does not happen before e2 and does not happen after e2, 
# then we say that e1 and e2 happen concurrently.
# Within a single goroutine, the happens-before order is the order expressed by the program.

- A read _r_ of a variable _v_ is allowed to observe a write _w_ to _v_ if both of the following hold:
    1. `r` does not happen before `w`.
    2. There is no other write `w` to v that happens after `w` but before `r`.

# To guarantee that a read _r_ of a variable _v_ observes a particular write _w_ to _v_, ensure that _w_ is the only write _r_ is allowed to observe.
- That is, _r_ is guaranteed to observe w if both of the following hold:
    1. `w` happens before `r`.
    2. Any other write to the shared variable `v` either happens before `w` or after `r`.

Both conditions equivalent if there is no concurrency, but otherwise the second is stronger.

# This pair of conditions is stronger than the first pair; it requires that there are no other writes happening concurrently with w or r.
# Within a single goroutine, there is no concurrency, so the two definitions are equivalent.

# The exit of a goroutine is not guaranteed to happen before any event in the program.


* 
The goroutine creation happens before it's execution begins.
But the exit of a goroutine is not guaranteed to happen before any event in the program.
.play goroutine1.go
the assignment to a is not followed by any synchronization event, so it is not guaranteed to be observed by any other goroutine.

# In fact, an aggressive compiler might delete the entire go statement.


* Channels
- The main method of communication between goroutines in go
- Has two main operations: _send_ and _recieve_. Also, it has _close_
- Operations on an _unbuffered_ channels are blocking.
- Buffered channel blocks _receiving_ when a queue is empty and _sending_ when it's full.
- A send on a channel happens before the corresponding receive from that channel completes.
- A receive from an _unbuffered_ channel happens before the send on that channel completes.
- The closing of a channel happens before a receive that returns a zero value because the channel is closed.

* Channels

.play goroutines2.go


* Mutex
- Mutex
- RWMutex
- For any sync.Mutex or sync.RWMutex variable _l_ and _n_ < _m_, call _n_ of l.Unlock() happens before call _m_ of l.Lock() returns.
- Mutex can be created as part of the structure 

* Atomic

An atomic operation is an operation that appears to the rest of the system to occur instantaneously. In other words no other go routines can see intermediate state of an atomic operation.

- Store, Add, Load, Swap, CAS
- atomic.Value
.code atomic.s
# XCHG -  If a memory operand is referenced, the processorâ€™s locking protocol is automatically implemented for the duration of the exchange operation, regardless of the presence or absence of the LOCK prefix or of the value of the IOPL.

* Race detector
- A data race occurs when two goroutines access the same variable concurrently and at least one of the accesses is a write. 
- The race detector is integrated with the go tool chain. When the -race command-line flag is set, the compiler instruments all memory accesses with code that records when and how the memory was accessed, while the runtime library watches for unsynchronized accesses to shared variables.
- It can catch races only when they are really triggered. Make sense to run on realistic load.
- Based on Google's  C/C++ ThreadSanitizer runtime library.
